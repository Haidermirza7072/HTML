    <p> A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on
        roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.[1][2]

        French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while Swiss inventor
        François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion powered automobile in 1808. The
        modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl
        Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One
        of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor
        Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and other
        parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[4] The car is considered
        an essential part of the developed economy.

        Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades,
        additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These
        include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use
        in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels.
        Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s
        and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[5][6] The transition from fossil fuels to
        electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[7] such as Project Drawdown's
        100 actionable solutions for climate change.[8]

        There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest
        payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees,
        taxes, and insurance.[9] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air
        pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic
        collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[10] Personal benefits include on-demand
        transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[11] Societal benefits include economic benefits, such
        as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from
        leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from
        place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[12]

        There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India,
        and other newly industrialized countries.[13]

        Running in water (aquarunning)

        Weight training
        Exercise is a body activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.[1]

        It is performed for various reasons, including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength,
        develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, improve health,[2] or simply for enjoyment.
        Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve
        well-being as well as mental health.[3][4]

        In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and
        the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.[5]

        Classification

        An aerobics exercise instructor in the United States instructs her class.
        Physical exercises are generally grouped into three types, depending on the overall effect they have on the
        human body:[6]

        Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen
        than it would while resting.[6] The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance.[7]
        Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking,
        dancing, playing tennis, continuous training, and long distance running.[6]
        Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle
        mass, as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination.[6] Examples of strength exercises are
        push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, squats, bench press. Anaerobic exercise also includes weight training, functional
        training, Eccentric Training, interval training, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training which increase
        short-term muscle strength.[6][8]
        Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles.[6] Activities such as stretching help to improve joint
        flexibility and keep muscles limber.[6] The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance
        of injury.[6][9]
        Physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy, agility, power, and speed.[10]

        Types of exercise can also be classified as dynamic or static. 'Dynamic' exercises such as steady running, tend
        to produce a lowering of the diastolic blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow.
        Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the systolic pressure to rise significantly,
        albeit transiently, during the performance of the exercise.[11]

        Health effects
        Main article: Exercise physiology
        Physical exercise is important for maintaining physical fitness and can contribute to maintaining a healthy
        weight, regulating the digestive system, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and
        joint mobility, promoting physiological well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune
        system. Some studies indicate that exercise may increase life expectancy and the overall quality of life.[12]
        People who participate in moderate to high levels of physical exercise have a lower mortality rate compared to
        individuals who by comparison are not physically active.[13] Moderate levels of exercise have been correlated
        with preventing aging by reducing inflammatory potential.[14] The majority of the benefits from exercise are
        achieved with around 3500 metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week, with diminishing returns at higher levels
        of activity.[15] For example, climbing stairs 10 minutes, vacuuming 15 minutes, gardening 20 minutes, running 20
        minutes, and walking or bicycling for transportation 25 minutes on a daily basis would together achieve about
        3000 MET minutes a week.[15] A lack of physical activity causes approximately 6% of the burden of disease from
        coronary heart disease, 7% of type 2 diabetes, 10% of breast cancer and 10% of colon cancer worldwide.[16]
        Overall, physical inactivity causes 9% of premature mortality worldwide.[16]

        Fitness
        Main article: Physical fitness
        Most people can increase fitness by increasing physical activity levels.[17] Increases in muscle size from
        resistance training are primarily determined by diet and testosterone.[18] This genetic variation in improvement
        from training is one of the key physiological differences between elite athletes and the larger
        population.[19][20] There is evidence that exercising in middle age may lead to better physical ability later in
        life.[21]

        Early motor skills and development is also related to physical activity and performance later in life. Children
        who are more proficient with motor skills early on are more inclined to be physically active, and thus tend to
        perform well in sports and have better fitness levels. Early motor proficiency has a positive correlation to
        childhood physical activity and fitness levels, while less proficiency in motor skills results in a more
        sedentary lifestyle.[22]

        </h1>
    </center>
    <p> A cartoon is a type of visual art that is typically drawn, frequently animated, in an unrealistic or
        semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image
        or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of
        illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a cartoonist,[1] and
        in the second sense they are usually called an animator.

        The concept originated in the Middle Ages, and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as
        a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. In the 19th century, beginning in Punch magazine in 1843,
        cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous artworks in magazines and newspapers. Then it also was
        used for political cartoons and comic strips. When the medium developed, in the early 20th century, it began to
        refer to animated films which resembled print cartoons.[2]

        Fine art

        Christ's Charge to Peter, one of the Raphael Cartoons, c. 1516, a full-size cartoon design for a tapestry
        A cartoon (from Italian: cartone and Dutch: karton—words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a
        full-size drawing made on sturdy paper as a design or modello for a painting, stained glass, or tapestry.
        Cartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes, to accurately link the component parts of the
        composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days (giornate).[3] In media such as stained tapestry
        or stained glass, the cartoon was handed over by the artist to the skilled craftsmen who produced the final
        work.

        Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or "pounced"
        over a cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster ("pouncing"). Cartoons by painters,
        such as the Raphael Cartoons in London, and examples by Leonardo da Vinci, are highly prized in their own right.
        Tapestry cartoons, usually colored, were followed with the eye by the weavers on the loom.[2][4]

        Mass media

        John Leech, Substance and Shadow (1843), published as Cartoon, No. 1 in Punch, the first use of the word cartoon
        to refer to a satirical drawing
        In print media, a cartoon is an drawing or series of drawings, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from
        1843, when Punch magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,[5] particularly sketches by John
        Leech.[6] The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new
        Palace of Westminster.


        Davy Jones' Locker, 1892 Punch cartoon by Sir John Tenniel
        Sir John Tenniel—illustrator of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland—joined Punch in 1850, and over 50 years
        contributed over two thousand cartoons.[7]

        Cartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.

        Modern single-panel gag cartoons, found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset
        caption positioned beneath, or, less often, a speech balloon.[8] Newspaper syndicates have also distributed
        single-panel gag cartoons by Mel Calman, Bill Holman, Gary Larson, George Lichty, Fred Neher and others. Many
        consider New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself).[9] The
        roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes Charles Addams, Charles Barsotti, and Chon Day.

        Bill Hoest, Jerry Marcus, and Virgil Partch began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated comic
        strips. Richard Thompson illustrated numerous feature articles in The Washington Post before creating his Cul de
        Sac comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated
        features such as Chester "Chet" Brown's All in Sport.

        Editorial cartoons are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also
        employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using irony or satire. The art usually acts as a visual
        metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include
        speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. Editorial cartoonists of note include Herblock, David Low,
        Jeff MacNelly, Mike Peters, and Gerald Scarfe.[2]

        Comic strips, also known as cartoon strips in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and
        are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly
        called "cartoons" themselves, but rather "comics" or "funnies". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as
        well as comic books and graphic novels—are usually referred to as "cartoonists". Although humor is the most
        prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists
        of humorous comic strips are Scott Adams, Charles Schulz, E. C. Segar, Mort Walker and Bill Watterson.[2]

        Political
        Main article: Political cartoon
        Political cartoons are like illustrated editorials that serve visual commentaries on political events. They
        offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does
        not get embittered.

        The pictorial satire of William Hogarth is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in
        18th century England.[10] George Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures
        in the 1750s.[10][11] The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of
        its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the
        medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.[12] By
        calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were
        directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to
        ridiculing the ambitions of revolutionary France and Napoleon.[12] George Cruikshank became the leading
        cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social
        caricatures of English life for popular publications.

        A cartoon showing a circle of men pointing their fingers at the man to their right with grimaces on their faces.
        Nast depicts the Tweed Ring: "Who stole the people's money?" / "'Twas him."
        By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the
        politics of the day. Thomas Nast, in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could
        redefine American cartooning.[13] His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the Tweed
        machine in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified
        him from Nast's cartoons.[14] In Britain, Sir John Tenniel was the toast of London.[15] In France under the July
        Monarchy, Honoré Daumier took up the new genre of political and social caricature, most famously lampooning the
        rotund King Louis Philippe.

        Political cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may
        complain, but can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a
        cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when J. H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of
        Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas
        claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday", when he allegedly
        betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to
        grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in
        European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the
        lawsuit and restored his reputation.[16]
